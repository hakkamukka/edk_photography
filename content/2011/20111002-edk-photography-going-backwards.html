excerpt: Welcome to the new EdK Photography, by Edward Khou. While the site may appear to have gone backwards aesthetically and functionally, I hope this will change in the months ahead as I tweak this site.

<%= item[:excerpt] %>

<p>Fundamentally, this site should now load faster considering everything in the backend is static (no stored procedures calls to a database, just pure HTML). Bits and bobs are somewhat dynamic but that is all thanks to plugins built with JavaScript for some good old client-side rendering. And the best part about this? Hosted on Amazon's S3.</p>

<p>The overall picture:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Faster browsing experience (I hope so; maybe faster to bounce off my website :D)</li>
	<li>Easier for me to maintain the content</li>
	<li>More control over the things I want to do</li>
</ol>

<p>... Now where is that Facebook footer and commenting system...</p>

<p>Have a good one!</p>
